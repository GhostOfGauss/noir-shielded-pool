# Shielded Pool TS

Types for working with the shielded pool, tested to be consistent with the Noir types.

Currently there's enough here to generate inputs and prove/verify the circuits using NoirJS.

This would be a good starting point for building a wallet or validator.

## Installation
```sh
yarn
yarn build
```

## Proving
Currently just uses the tests to produce a proof:
```sh
yarn test
```
